GDGTC Polymer Web Components Project
======================================



Web Components are no longer the future. They're here. What comes next is ensuring that we, as Web developers, deliver on their astounding potential.

## The Mission

Creating reusable Polymer Web Components and publishing them on [customelements.io](http://customelements.io/)

## How to Contribute
The Polymer team has assembled a rather excellent guide for [creating and publishing reusable Polymer components](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html). This is exactly the framework that we'll be following here. (The only difference, of course, will be the community-wide scale!)

All GDGTC components will be nested in this repository, within their own [submodule](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). The components will be initialized whenever we get a proposal from the community (or whenever inspiration simply strikes), and from there the hacking begins

**TODO**
 - Determine how to accept proposals (we could have     them posted via the main repo's Issues page)
 - Who can merge Pull Requests?
 - Outline Steps for registering a package on Bower.



## Qualification / Evaluation

Anyone is free to publish a component on their own at any time. However, we think leveraging the strength of our entire community offers a huge benefit in terms of being able to evaluate, test, critique, assist and improve the creations of each developer.

**TODO**
 - Outline ways that we can test and validate each component
 - What's the criteria for finally pubishing a component?

## Getting Up and Running


Armed with your favorite text editor, there are many ways to begin developing a Web application. We'll list a few of the most straightforward ways to work with Web Components and Polymer here.

- **Developing in the browser**
    - **TODO:** Outline steps for setting up Google Chrome IDE.


- **Setting up your Local Environment**
  - **TODO**: Outline basic software installation steps
    - Bower
    - Node/npm
    - Link to steps for spinning up a local dev server
    - Polymer Seed app

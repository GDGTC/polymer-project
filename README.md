GDGTC Polymer Web Components Project
======================================



Web Components are no longer the future. They're here. What comes next is ensuring that we, as Web developers, deliver on their astounding potential.

The GDGTC Polymer Web Components project is a set of Web Components repositories -- much like those found on the [Polymer team's main profile](https://github.com/Polymer) -- where Web Component ideas proposed by the group can be actively developed and contributed to.

This page will attempt to serve its comprehensive guide.

## The Mission

Creating reusable Polymer Web Components and delivering a published build to

1. [customelements.io](http://customelements.io/)

2. [The Bower registry](http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/)

## How to Contribute
Whether at our monthly Meetups or through the issues tab of this repo, we're always looking to gather ideas for new Web Components and open up a new project to the community.

The Polymer team has assembled a rather excellent guide for [creating and publishing reusable Polymer components](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html). This is exactly the framework that we'll be following here. (The only difference, of course, will be the community-wide scale!)

The components will be initialized whenever we get a proposal from the community (or whenever inspiration simply strikes), and from there the hacking begins

**TODO**
 - Determine how to accept proposals (we could have     them posted via the main repo's Issues page)
 - Who can merge Pull Requests?
 - Outline Steps for registering a package on Bower.



## Qualification / Evaluation

Anyone is free to publish a component on their own at any time. However, we think leveraging the strength of our entire community offers a huge benefit in terms of being able to evaluate, test, critique, assist and improve the creations of each developer.

**TODO**
 - Outline ways that we can test and validate each component
 - What's the criteria for finally pubishing a component?

## Getting Up and Running


Armed with your favorite text editor, there are many ways to begin developing a Web application. We'll list a few of the most straightforward ways to work with Web Components and Polymer here.

- **Developing in the browser**
    - **TODO:** Outline steps for setting up Google Chrome IDE.


- **Setting up your Local Environment**
  - **TODO**: Outline basic software installation steps
    - Bower
    - Node/npm
    - Link to steps for spinning up a local dev server
    - Polymer Seed app
